|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DeepDive`     | Detailed technical explanations              |
| `HowTo`        | Step-by-step deployment or config guides     |
| `Troubleshoot` | Troubleshooting known issues                 |
| `Reference`    | Reference configurations and resources       |

### `<topics>`:
- `ArcGateway` - Arc Gateway and related services
- `OutboundConnectivity` - Network connectivity and routing
- `SDNExpress` - Software-defined networking components
- `HostNetworking` - Host-level network configuration
- `TOR` - Top of Rack switch management

### `<specifics>`:
- Use descriptive keywords that summarize the content, e.g., `2Node-Switchless-Storage`,  `Recreate-Intent-No-SRIOV`, etc.
- Try to keep it concise but informative.

### Examples:
- `Reference-TOR-Explicit-Congestion-Notification.md`
