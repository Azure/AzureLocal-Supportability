## 2. Deployment Patterns Overview

Azure Local supports three primary physical network deployment patterns, each optimized for different use cases, scale requirements, and operational considerations. The fundamental difference between these patterns lies in how storage traffic is handled and isolated:

### Deployment Pattern Descriptions

**Switchless Deployment**
A cost-effective design optimized for smaller deployments where storage traffic flows directly between nodes without dedicated switching infrastructure. This pattern minimizes hardware requirements and is ideal for edge locations and remote sites where simplicity and cost optimization are priorities.

![Switchless with 2 ToRs](images/AzureLocalPhysicalNetworkDiagram_Switchless.png)

**Switched Deployment**  
A high-performance design utilizing dedicated NICs for management/compute and storage traffic, providing storage physical isolation. This pattern is recommended for enterprise deployments requiring maximum storage performance and dedicated bandwidth allocation for storage workloads.

![Switched with 2 ToRs](images/AzureLocalPhysicalNetworkDiagram_Switched.png)

**Fully Converged Deployment**
A balanced design where all traffic types (management, compute, storage) share the same physical NICs through VLAN segmentation. This pattern minimizes hardware footprint while maintaining high scalability. **Design Consistency**: Follows the same storage VLAN pattern as Switched deployment with "One Storage VLAN per TOR" as the baseline configuration to ensure RDMA traffic utilization and prevent storage traffic cross the ToR peer links.

![Fully-Converged with 2 ToRs](images/AzureLocalPhysicalNetworkDiagram_FullyConverged.png)


### Deployment Pattern Comparison

| Deployment Pattern  | Host NIC Configuration | ToR Switch VLAN Configuration | Primary Use Cases |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Switchless** | 2 NICs to switches (M+C traffic) + (N−1) direct inter-node NICs (S traffic) | Trunk ports with M, C VLANs only; no storage VLANs on ToRs | Edge deployments, remote sites, cost-sensitive environments |
| **Switched** | 4 NICs per host: 2 for M+C traffic, 2 dedicated for storage | M and C VLANs on both ToRs; S1 VLAN exclusive to ToR1, S2 VLAN exclusive to ToR2 | Enterprise deployments requiring dedicated storage performance and traffic isolation |
| **Fully Converged** | 2 NICs per host carrying all traffic types (M+C+S) via VLAN segmentation | **Baseline**: One Storage VLAN per TOR (S1→ToR1, S2→ToR2). **Optional**: Both storage VLANs on both ToRs for enhanced resilience | General-purpose deployments balancing performance, simplicity, and hardware efficiency |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Storage VLAN Configuration**: Storage VLANs should be configured as **Layer 2 networks without IP subnets** to optimize network design. Since Azure Local nodes handle storage traffic tagging, ensure these VLANs are configured as **tagged VLANs on trunk ports** across all ToR switches.

## 4. Network Troubleshooting Methodology

This section provides systematic troubleshooting procedures for identifying and resolving common physical network issues in Azure Local environments. Follow these procedures in sequence for efficient problem isolation and resolution.

### 4.1 Deployment Pattern & Interface Configuration Verification

#### Troubleshooting Flowchart

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Deployment Pattern?}
    
    B --> C[Fully Converged]
    B --> D[Switched]
    B --> E[Switchless]

    C --> C1["Ensure both host-facing ports are set to trunk mode with tagged VLANs: M, C, S1, S2"]
    D --> D1["Ensure ToR1 host port is trunk with tagged VLANs: M, C, S1; ToR2 host port is trunk with tagged VLANs: M, C, S2"]
    E --> E1["Ensure host ports to switch are trunk with tagged VLANs: M, C only (no S1/S2); Storage uses host-to-host NICs"]

    C1 --> F["Verify link is up and trunk ports are not shut down"]
    D1 --> F
    E1 --> F

```
#### Log Collection & Analysis

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples use Cisco NX-OS for reference. Please adjust the commands based on your switch vendor's CLI.

##### Interface Configuration Verification
- `show run interface <interface_name>`  
  - Verify the interface is configured in **trunk mode**
  - Confirm that required VLANs (M, C, S1, S2) are **allowed** based on the deployment pattern
  - Ensure the interface is **not shutdown** (`no shutdown`)



In this example, the Azure Local is deployed with **Switched** pattern, **7 is M, 201 is C, 711 is S1, and 712 is S2**. So the ToR1 and ToR2 Hosts-Facing ports should be configured as follows:

###### TOR1

```
##### Log Collection & Analysis
- `show lldp neighbors`  
  - Verify LLDP entries match expected host MAC addresses and ports
  - Check for any discrepancies in neighbor information

###### On Azure Local Host
``` console
[Host1]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Get-NetAdapter | select Name,MacAddress,Status

Name                                 MacAddress        Status

ethernet 3                           C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E7 Up

```

###### On ToR Switch

``` console
# on TOR1
TOR1# show lldp neighbors
Capability codes:
  (R) Router, (B) Bridge, (T) Telephone, (C) DOCSIS Cable Device
  (W) WLAN Access Point, (P) Repeater, (S) Station, (O) Other
Device ID            Local Intf      Hold-time  Capability  Port ID
c84b.d690.c7e5       Eth1/1          30                     c84b.d690.c7e5
...
c84b.d690.c7e7       Eth1/21         30                     c84b.d690.c7e7
...

# on TOR2
TOR2# show lldp neighbors
Capability codes:
  (R) Router, (B) Bridge, (T) Telephone, (C) DOCSIS Cable Device
  (W) WLAN Access Point, (P) Repeater, (S) Station, (O) Other
Device ID            Local Intf      Hold-time  Capability  Port ID
c84b.d690.c7e6       Eth1/1          30                     c84b.d690.c7e6
...
c84b.d690.c7e8       Eth1/21         30                     c84b.d690.c7e8
...
```

So the cable mapping based on the lldp neighbors output is as follows:

| Host Name | NIC Name     | MAC Address           | Connected ToR | ToR Interface     |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Host1     | Ethernet     | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E5      | ToR1          | Ethernet1/1     |
| Host1     | Ethernet 2   | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E6      | ToR2          | Ethernet1/1   |
| Host1     | Ethernet 3   | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E7      | ToR1          | Ethernet1/21    |
| Host1     | Ethernet 4   | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E8      | ToR2          | Ethernet1/21   |

### 4.3 MAC Address Learning Verification

Switches learn which MAC addresses are connected to which ports and VLANs. If a switch doesn’t learn the correct MAC for a host’s NICs, traffic won’t reach the intended host. This step ensures each host is properly connected and the network knows where to send traffic.

#### Troubleshooting Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Start] --> B[Run 'show mac address-table' on ToR]
    B --> B1{Is MAC address visible for each host NIC VLAN?}
    B1 -->|Yes| C[MAC learning correctly]
    B1 -->|No| D[Check switch port trunk config and host NIC config to align VLANs]
```

##### Log Collection & Analysis
- `show mac address-table`  
  - Verify that the MAC addresses of each host NIC are learned on the expected VLANs
  - Check for any missing or incorrect entries

###### On Azure Local Host
``` Powershell
[Host1]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Get-NetAdapter | ft InterfaceAlias, VlanID, MacAddress

### 4.4 Advanced Troubleshooting

This document covers fundamental physical network troubleshooting procedures. For advanced networking topics including RDMA optimization, latency tuning, Software Defined Networking (SDN) configuration, BGP routing, MLAG implementation, and Spanning Tree Protocol troubleshooting, please refer to the dedicated technical documentation available in the Azure Local documentation library.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why does Azure Local utilize two storage networks in the design architecture? Can a single storage network be implemented instead?

**A:**  
Azure Local implements **dual storage VLANs** (typically VLAN 711 and VLAN 712) to ensure **high availability and fault tolerance** for storage traffic. The core design principle follows **"One Storage VLAN per TOR"** architecture for consistency across deployment patterns.

It’s true that **Windows SET (Switch Embedded Teaming)** provides NIC-level fault tolerance. However, **RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)** traffic is **tied to a specific physical NIC and its upstream switch**. If there’s only **one storage VLAN**, RDMA traffic may be forced to cross the **peer link** between the ToR switches — which is undesirable in performance-sensitive scenarios.

- In a **Fully Converged** deployment, **Network Intent with SET** is used because all VLANs (Management, Compute, Storage) must be available across the teamed NICs.

- In contrast, for a **Switched** deployment, only **Network Intent** is applied — **SET is not used** — because **storage (SMB) traffic uses dedicated RDMA NICs directly**, without teaming.


For example, in a **switched scenario**:
- If **Host1** uses **NIC1 → ToR1**
- And **Host2** uses **NIC2 → ToR2**
- Then all RDMA storage traffic between them must **cross the peer link**

```txt
          +--------+            +--------+
          |  ToR1  | <--------> |  ToR2  |
          +--------+  peer link +--------+
             |  |                  |  |
             |  |                  |  |
         +---+--+--+           +---+--+--+
         | NIC1   |           | NIC2   |
     Host1       Host2     Host1       Host2
     VLAN711     VLAN711   VLAN711     VLAN711

```

This introduces **unnecessary latency and jitter**, which can degrade RDMA performance.

By using **two storage VLANs** (e.g., 711 and 712), each mapped to separate NICs and switches, the design allows RDMA traffic to **stay local** to the switch as much as possible. Traffic only crosses the peer link **when a failover occurs**, not during normal operation.

```txt
          +--------+            +--------+
          |  ToR1  | <--------> |  ToR2  |
          +--------+  peer link +--------+
             |  |                  |  |
             |  |                  |  |
         +---+--+--+           +---+--+--+
         | NIC1   |           | NIC2   |
     Host1       Host2     Host1       Host2
     VLAN711     VLAN711   VLAN712     VLAN712

```

#### Summary:
- ✅ SET provides link-level redundancy
- ✅ Two storage VLANs ensure **RDMA-level failover** and **ToR-local communication**
- 🚫 One VLAN risks **cross-ToR RDMA**, which reduces performance

### Q: Management and Compute VLANs are allowed across the ToRs peer link. Do I also need to allow the Storage VLANs across the peer link between the two ToR switches?

**A:** 
- In a **Switched** deployment, **Storage VLANs do not need to be allowed** across the ToR peer link. Each host uses a dedicated Storage VLAN that maps to a specific ToR switch. This keeps storage traffic local, avoiding cross-ToR paths.

- In a **Fully Converged** deployment, **Storage VLANs must be allowed** on the ToR peer link. While regular storage traffic doesn’t cross ToRs, **failover scenarios** make the peer link critical.

#### Fully Converged Deployment - Baseline Configuration (Recommended)

- **TOR1**: Handles Storage VLAN 711 only  
- **TOR2**: Handles Storage VLAN 712 only  
- Host1 → NIC1 → Storage VLAN 711 → ToR1  
- Host1 → NIC2 → Storage VLAN 712 → ToR2  
- Each ToR handles its own storage traffic  
- **No need to allow Storage VLANs across the peer link**
- **Ensures consistent design pattern** and **guaranteed RDMA usage**

#### Fully Converged Deployment - Optional Enhanced Configuration

- Both Storage VLANs (711 and 712) configured on both ToRs  
- Host1 → NIC1 → ToR1 (can use either VLAN 711 or 712)  
- Host1 → NIC2 → ToR2 (can use either VLAN 711 or 712)  
- **Storage VLANs must be allowed** on the ToR peer link for failover scenarios
- **Enhanced resilience primarily benefits physical NIC failure scenarios**

**Key Considerations:**
- **Application Layer**: Storage applications only care about available SMB channels and whether they support RDMA
- **Network Layer**: Physical network provides the underlying connectivity paths
- **Failover Behavior**: If RDMA channels are unavailable, SMB will automatically fall back to standard TCP traffic
- **Two-Layer Design**: Application layer (SMB channels) operates independently of network layer (VLAN paths)
- **Additional Complexity**: Enhanced configuration increases network complexity without significant performance benefits under normal operations

#### Switched Deployment

- Host1 → NIC1 → Storage VLAN 711 → ToR1  
- Host1 → NIC2 → Storage VLAN 712 → ToR2  
- Each ToR handles its own storage traffic  
- No cross-ToR forwarding needed  
- **No need to allow Storage VLANs across the peer link**


### Q: Are **DCB (Data Center Bridging)** features like **PFC** and **ETS** needed for RDMA in Azure Local, including both **RoCEv2** and **iWARP**?

**A:**  
While **DCB features** such as **Priority Flow Control (PFC)** and **Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS)** are not strictly required, they are **highly recommended** for both **RoCEv2** and **iWARP** to optimize RDMA performance in Azure Local environments.

Overall Comparison:

- **RoCEv2** uses **UDP**, which is fast but **cannot tolerate packet loss**.  
  → It **needs PFC** to prevent packet drops, and DCB is **required** for optimal performance.

- **iWARP** uses **TCP**, which can handle **packet loss** but is **slower**.  
  → It **doesn’t require PFC**, but enabling **DCB** can still help reduce latency.

> [!NOTE]
>  Even though **iWARP** uses reliable TCP transport and does **not mandate DCB**, enabling **PFC and ETS** can still help minimize congestion and latency, especially in mixed RDMA environments.  
> Enabling DCB across the fabric ensures **consistent, predictable low-latency** behavior for RDMA workloads.

### Q: Why can't I see the storage IP in the ARP table, while the Compute and Management IPs are visible?

**A:**
This is expected behavior in Azure Local deployments.

In the reference design, the **Storage VLAN is configured as a Layer 2 (L2) network without an IP subnet**. Storage traffic is **VLAN-tagged and handled entirely at Layer 2**, so it doesn't involve IP-based communication or ARP resolution. In contrast, **Management and Compute VLANs are Layer 3 networks** with IP addresses, which is why their entries appear in the ARP table.
