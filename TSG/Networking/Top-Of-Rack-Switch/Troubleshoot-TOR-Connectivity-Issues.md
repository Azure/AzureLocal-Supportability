## 1. Network Troubleshooting Methodology

This section provides systematic troubleshooting procedures for identifying and resolving common physical network issues in Azure Local environments. **Follow these procedures in sequence** for efficient problem isolation and resolution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sequential Approach**: Each troubleshooting step is designed to build upon the previous one. Complete each section fully before moving to the next to ensure accurate diagnosis.

### Troubleshooting Checklist Overview

Before diving into detailed procedures, use this quick checklist:

- [ ] **Step 1.1**: Verify deployment pattern and VLAN configuration
- [ ] **Step 1.2**: Confirm physical connectivity using LLDP
- [ ] **Step 1.3**: Validate MAC address learning on switches
- [ ] **Step 1.4**: Escalate to advanced troubleshooting if needed

### 1.1 Deployment Pattern & Interface Configuration Verification

**Purpose**: Verify that switch interfaces are correctly configured according to your Azure Local deployment pattern (Switchless, Switched, or Fully Converged).

**What this step validates**:
- Interface trunk mode configuration
- VLAN assignments match deployment pattern
- Physical interface status (up/down)

#### Troubleshooting Flowchart

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B{Deployment Pattern?}
    
    B --> C[Fully Converged]
    B --> D[Switched]
    B --> E[Switchless]

    C --> C1["Ensure both host-facing ports are set to trunk mode with tagged VLANs: M, C, S1, S2"]
    D --> D1["Ensure ToR1 host port is trunk with tagged VLANs: M, C, S1; ToR2 host port is trunk with tagged VLANs: M, C, S2"]
    E --> E1["Ensure host ports to switch are trunk with tagged VLANs: M, C only (no S1/S2); Storage uses host-to-host NICs"]

    C1 --> F["Verify link is up and trunk ports are not shut down"]
    D1 --> F
    E1 --> F

```
#### Log Collection & Analysis

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples use Cisco NX-OS for reference. Please adjust the commands based on your switch vendor's CLI.

##### Interface Configuration Verification
- `show run interface <interface_name>`  
  - Verify the interface is configured in **trunk mode**
  - Confirm that required VLANs (M, C, S1, S2) are **allowed** based on the deployment pattern
  - Ensure the interface is **not shutdown** (`no shutdown`)



In this example, the Azure Local is deployed with **Switched** pattern, **7 is M, 201 is C, 711 is S1, and 712 is S2**. So the ToR1 and ToR2 Hosts-Facing ports should be configured as follows:

###### TOR1

```

##### Interface Status Verification

- `show interface <interface_name>`  
  - Confirm the interface is **up and operational**
  - Check for absence of **errors**, or **drops**, especially **CRC errors**.

### 1.2 Physical Connectivity Verification

**Purpose**: Confirm physical cable connections between Azure Local hosts and ToR switches using LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol).

**What this step validates**:
- Physical cable connections are correct
- LLDP discovery between hosts and switches
- Port-to-port mapping accuracy

#### Troubleshooting Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Start]
  B{Is LLDP enabled on switch?}
  A --> B
  B -- No --> B1[Enable LLDP Globally]
  B1 --> C[show lldp neighbors]
  B -- Yes --> C

  C --> D{Do LLDP entries match expected host MACs and ports?}
  D -- Yes --> E[Cabling correct]
  D -- No --> F[Possible cabling issue]

```
##### Log Collection & Analysis
- `show lldp neighbors`  
  - Verify LLDP entries match expected host MAC addresses and ports
  - Check for any discrepancies in neighbor information

###### On Azure Local Host
``` console
[Host1]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Get-NetAdapter | select Name,MacAddress,Status

Name                                 MacAddress        Status
----                                 ----------        ------
ethernet 2                           C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E6 Up
ethernet 4                           C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E8 Up
ethernet                             C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E5 Up
ethernet 3                           C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E7 Up

```

###### On ToR Switch

``` console
# on TOR1
TOR1# show lldp neighbors
Capability codes:
  (R) Router, (B) Bridge, (T) Telephone, (C) DOCSIS Cable Device
  (W) WLAN Access Point, (P) Repeater, (S) Station, (O) Other
Device ID            Local Intf      Hold-time  Capability  Port ID
c84b.d690.c7e5       Eth1/1          30                     c84b.d690.c7e5
...
c84b.d690.c7e7       Eth1/21         30                     c84b.d690.c7e7
...

# on TOR2
TOR2# show lldp neighbors
Capability codes:
  (R) Router, (B) Bridge, (T) Telephone, (C) DOCSIS Cable Device
  (W) WLAN Access Point, (P) Repeater, (S) Station, (O) Other
Device ID            Local Intf      Hold-time  Capability  Port ID
c84b.d690.c7e6       Eth1/1          30                     c84b.d690.c7e6
...
c84b.d690.c7e8       Eth1/21         30                     c84b.d690.c7e8
...
```

So the cable mapping based on the lldp neighbors output is as follows:

| Host Name | NIC Name     | MAC Address           | Connected ToR | ToR Interface     |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Host1     | Ethernet     | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E5      | ToR1          | Ethernet1/1     |
| Host1     | Ethernet 2   | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E6      | ToR2          | Ethernet1/1   |
| Host1     | Ethernet 3   | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E7      | ToR1          | Ethernet1/21    |
| Host1     | Ethernet 4   | C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E8      | ToR2          | Ethernet1/21   |

### 1.3 MAC Address Learning Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure switches are learning MAC addresses correctly for each host NIC on the appropriate VLANs.

**What this step validates**:
- MAC address population in switch tables
- VLAN-to-MAC address mapping
- Layer 2 forwarding table accuracy

Switches learn which MAC addresses are connected to which ports and VLANs. If a switch doesn't learn the correct MAC for a host's NICs, traffic won't reach the intended host. This step ensures each host is properly connected and the network knows where to send traffic.

#### Troubleshooting Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Start] --> B[Run 'show mac address-table' on ToR]
    B --> B1{Is MAC address visible for each host NIC VLAN?}
    B1 -->|Yes| C[MAC learning correctly]
    B1 -->|No| D[Check switch port trunk config and host NIC config to align VLANs]
```

##### Log Collection & Analysis
- `show mac address-table`  
  - Verify that the MAC addresses of each host NIC are learned on the expected VLANs
  - Check for any missing or incorrect entries

###### On Azure Local Host
``` Powershell
[Host1]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Get-NetAdapter | ft InterfaceAlias, VlanID, MacAddress
 
InterfaceAlias VlanID MacAddress
-------------- ------ ----------
ethernet 4        712 C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E8
ethernet 3        711 C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E7
ethernet 2        0   C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E6
ethernet          0   C8-4B-D6-90-C7-E5

## 2. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How can I verify that VLANs are properly configured for my deployment pattern?

**A:**
Use the following verification matrix based on your deployment pattern:

**Switchless Deployment:**
- Host-facing switch ports: Trunk mode with Management (M) and Compute (C) VLANs only
- No Storage VLANs should be configured on ToR switches
- Verify direct host-to-host storage connections are functioning

**Switched Deployment:**
- ToR1 host ports: Trunk mode with M, C, and S1 VLANs
- ToR2 host ports: Trunk mode with M, C, and S2 VLANs  
- Storage VLANs should NOT be allowed on the peer link between ToRs

**Fully Converged Deployment:**
- Both ToR host ports: Trunk mode with M, C, S1, and S2 VLANs (Baseline)
- Storage VLANs may need to be allowed on peer link depending on configuration choice

### Q: Why am I seeing CRC errors or packet drops on storage interfaces?

**A:**
CRC errors and packet drops on storage interfaces typically indicate:

1. **Physical Issues:**
   - Faulty cables or transceivers
   - Poor cable connections
   - Electromagnetic interference

2. **Configuration Issues:**
   - Missing or incorrect DCB (PFC/ETS) configuration
   - MTU mismatches between host and switch
   - Incorrect RDMA settings

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check physical connections and replace cables if necessary
2. Verify DCB configuration on storage interfaces
3. Ensure MTU is consistently configured (typically 9000+ bytes)
4. Review RDMA adapter settings on Azure Local hosts

### Q: How do I troubleshoot missing MAC addresses in the switch's MAC address table?

**A:**
Missing MAC addresses usually indicate Layer 2 connectivity or VLAN configuration issues:

1. **Verify VLAN Configuration:**
   - Ensure host NICs are configured with correct VLAN tags
   - Confirm switch ports allow the required VLANs in trunk mode

2. **Check Interface Status:**
   - Verify both host NIC and switch port are up and operational
   - Look for link flapping or negotiation issues

3. **Generate Traffic:**
   ```powershell
   # On Azure Local host - generate traffic to populate MAC table
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <target-host> -Port 445
   ```

4. **Verify Switch Port Configuration:**
   ```console
   # Check if port is in correct mode and VLANs are allowed
   show interface ethernet 1/1 switchport
   show interface ethernet 1/1 trunk
   ```

### Q: Why can't I see storage IP addresses in the ARP table, while Management and Compute IPs are visible?

**A:**
This is **expected behavior** in Azure Local deployments and not an issue that requires troubleshooting.

**Explanation:**
- **Storage VLANs** are typically configured as **Layer 2 (L2) networks** without IP subnets
- Storage traffic is **VLAN-tagged and handled entirely at Layer 2**
- No IP-based communication or ARP resolution occurs for storage traffic
- **Management and Compute VLANs** are **Layer 3 networks** with IP addresses, which is why their entries appear in the ARP table

This design is intentional and optimizes storage performance by eliminating unnecessary Layer 3 overhead.
