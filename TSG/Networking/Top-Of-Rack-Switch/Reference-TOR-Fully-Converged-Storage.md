## Overview

Azure Local's fully converged physical network architecture integrates **management**, **compute**, and **storage** traffic over the same physical Ethernet interfaces. This design minimizes hardware footprint while maximizing scalability, and simplicity of deployment.

## Key Components

- **Top-of-Rack (ToR) Switches**: Physical switches that provide redundant L2/L3 connectivity. Each Azure Local machine connects to two separate ToR switches for high availability, with all switch ports configured as IEEE 802.1Q trunk ports to support multiple VLANs.

- **Azure Local Machine**: A physical host running the Azure Local OS. In a fully converged design, each machine typically has **two high-speed physical NICs** (10Gbps or higher) that **support RDMA** (Remote Direct Memory Access). These interfaces are used to carry **management, compute, and storage** traffic over a unified logical fabric.

- **Network ATC**: Azure Local intent-based networking framework used to define and deploy logical networking configurations (called "intents") on the hosts. In the fully converged pattern, a single `Management + Compute + Storage` intent is cross the NICs.

- **SET (Switch Embedded Teaming)**: A Windows-native NIC teaming method that creates a single logical interface from multiple physical NICs. It operates in **switch-independent mode**, also SET is the **only** supported vmswitch technology on Azure Local.



## Fully Converged Network Design – Physical Topology

This example illustrates a **fully converged Azure Local environment**, where **Management**, **Compute**, and **Storage** traffic all share the same NICs using **VLAN tagging**. While the diagram shows a dual-node-to-ToR cabling structure, the same design easily scales from **2 to 16 nodes** with minimal changes.

> [!NOTE]
> - Fully converged: All traffic types (Mgmt, Compute, Storage) run over the same physical links  
> -  Redundant ToR: Each node connects to both TOR1 and TOR2  
> -  SET (Switch Embedded Team): Used on the host to bond NICs for fault tolerance

### Example: Three-Host Cabling Map

The following table shows physical connections between NICs and the Top-of-Rack switches in a **3-Host setup**. Each Host has two Ethernet ports, and each port connects to a different ToR switch to ensure redundancy.

#### Host 1

| Device    | Interface |      | Device | Interface   |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Host1** | NIC A     | <==> | TOR1   | Ethernet1/1 |
| **Host1** | NIC B     | <==> | TOR2   | Ethernet1/1 |

#### Host 2

| Device    | Interface |      | Device | Interface   |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Host2** | NIC A     | <==> | TOR1   | Ethernet1/2 |
| **Host2** | NIC B     | <==> | TOR2   | Ethernet1/2 |

#### Host 3

| Device    | Interface |      | Device | Interface   |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Host3** | NIC A     | <==> | TOR1   | Ethernet1/3 |
| **Host3** | NIC B     | <==> | TOR2   | Ethernet1/3 |


### VLAN Architecture

| VLAN Type     | Purpose                             | VLAN ID |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| Management    | Cluster and Host management traffic | 7       |
| Compute       | VM / workload traffic               | 201     |
| Storage 1     | SMB over RDMA (path 1)              | 711     |
| Storage 2     | SMB over RDMA (path 2)              | 712     |

> [!NOTE]
> Two storage VLANs are used to ensure **path-level redundancy** for RDMA traffic, enhancing **storage high availability**. Each VLAN can map to different physical NICs and ToR switches.

### ToR Switches

This design uses **two physical switches** as Top-of-Rack (ToR) devices to provide uplink connectivity for all Azure Local nodes.

- The ToR switches may be configured in **MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation)** for redundancy, but it is **not strictly required**, as redundancy is already achieved through the host-side **SET (Switch Embedded Teaming)** configuration.
- The **core network layer** (e.g., data center routers or firewalls) is considered **out of scope** for this document.

#### Interface & VLAN Configuration

Using **Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX3 (version 10.x)** as an example platform:

- **VLAN 7** – Management VLAN  
  - Routed in L3 (SVI configured)  
  - Set as the **native VLAN** on trunk ports  
- **VLAN 201** – Compute VLAN  
  - Routed in L3 (SVI configured)  
  - Tagged VLAN on trunk ports  
- **VLANs 711 and 712** – Storage VLANs  
  - Layer 2 only (no SVI)  
  - Both tagged on trunk ports for RDMA SMB traffic paths

##### Sample NX-OS Configuration (Simplified)

```console
vlan 7
  name Management_7
vlan 201
  name Compute_201
vlan 711
  name Storage_711
vlan 712
  name Storage_712

interface Vlan7
  description Management
  no shutdown
  mtu 9216
  ip address 10.101.176.2/24
  hsrp 7
    ip 100.101.176.1

interface Vlan201
  description Compute
  no shutdown
  mtu 9216
  ip address 10.101.177.2/24
  hsrp 201
    ip 100.101.177.1

interface Ethernet1/1-3
  description To_Azure_Local_Host_FullyConverged
  switchport
  switchport mode trunk
  switchport trunk native vlan 7
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 7,201,711,712
  priority-flow-control mode on send-tlv
  spanning-tree port type edge trunk
  mtu 9216
  service-policy type qos input AZS_SERVICES

> QoS policies and routing design (e.g., uplinks, BGP/OSPF, default gateway) will be introduced in a separate document.


#### Validation in Lab Environment

##### On Azure Local Host
- Verify the host's MAC address and VLAN configuration.
- For virtual adapters, run `Get-VMNetworkAdapterIsolation` to view VLAN isolation settings.


```powershell
[Host3]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Get-NetAdapter | ft InterfaceAlias, VlanID, MacAddress

InterfaceAlias                     VlanID MacAddress       
--------------                     ------ ----------       
ethernet                                0 0C-42-A1-F9-69-4A
vSMB(managementcompute#ethernet 2)        00-15-5D-C8-20-07
ethernet 2                              0 0C-42-A1-F9-69-4B
vManagement(managementcompute)            0C-42-A1-F9-69-4A
vSMB(managementcompute#ethernet)          00-15-5D-C8-20-06

[Host3]: PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Get-VMNetworkAdapterIsolation -ManagementOS | ft ParentAdapter, IsolationMode, DefaultIsolationID

ParentAdapter                                                         IsolationMode DefaultIsolationID
-------------                                                         ------------- ------------------
VMInternalNetworkAdapter, Name = 'vSMB(managementcompute#ethernet)'            Vlan                711
VMInternalNetworkAdapter, Name = 'vManagement(managementcompute)'              Vlan                  0
VMInternalNetworkAdapter, Name = 'vSMB(managementcompute#ethernet 2)'          Vlan                712

```

##### On ToR Switches

- Verify the MAC address table for each ToR switch to ensure the host's MAC addresses are learned correctly.

```console
# On ToR1
TOR1# show mac address-table interface ethernet 1/3
Legend:
        * - primary entry, G - Gateway MAC, (R) - Routed MAC, O - Overlay MAC
        age - seconds since last seen,+ - primary entry using vPC Peer-Link,
        (T) - True, (F) - False, C - ControlPlane MAC, ~ - vsan
   VLAN     MAC Address      Type      age     Secure NTFY Ports
---------+-----------------+--------+---------+------+----+------------------
*    7     0c42.a1f9.694a   dynamic  0         F      F    Eth1/3
*  711     0015.5dc8.2006   dynamic  0         F      F    Eth1/3

# On ToR2
TOR2# show mac address-table interface ethernet 1/3
Legend:
        * - primary entry, G - Gateway MAC, (R) - Routed MAC, O - Overlay MAC
        age - seconds since last seen,+ - primary entry using vPC Peer-Link,
        (T) - True, (F) - False, C - ControlPlane MAC, ~ - vsan
   VLAN     MAC Address      Type      age     Secure NTFY Ports
---------+-----------------+--------+---------+------+----+------------------
*  712     0015.5dc8.2007   dynamic  0         F      F    Eth1/3

```

## Q&A
### Q: In Fully Converged Network Design, can I configure TOR1 only allow only Storage VLAN 711, and TOR2 only allow Storage VLAN 712?

**A:** 
No, this configuration is not supported and will lead to connectivity issues.

When using **SET (Switch Embedded Teaming)** on the host, both physical NICs are treated as a single logical interface. The operating system dynamically balances traffic — including storage — across both NICs. This means that **Storage VLAN 712 traffic could be sent through the NIC connected to TOR1**, and vice versa.

If the switch port on TOR1 only allows VLAN 711, it will **drop any traffic tagged with VLAN 712**, leading to packet loss and connectivity issues.

To ensure **redundancy, load balancing, and high availability**, all trunk ports on the ToR switches must be configured to **allow all required VLANs**, including Management (7), Compute (201), and both Storage VLANs (711 and 712).
