## Overview

This test is checking something on your computer/server and it's not working correctly. Specifically, it's checking that your computer's clock is set correctly and matches other computers in your network. If computers have different times, they can't work together properly. The error message says: "NTP server is configured on 'F0750R54C03N02' as 'time.windows.com'. Expected '10.236.120.11'"

### Why This Matters

This check needs to pass before Azure Local can be installed. If this keeps failing after you try to fix it, it means either: (1) the fix instructions aren't clear enough, (2) there's something unusual about your setup, or (3) there might be a bug in the test itself.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Review Environment Validator Output

Review the Environment Validator output JSON. Here is an example of the error detail:

```
NTP server is configured on 'F0750R54C03N02' as 'time.windows.com'. Expected '10.236.120.11'
```

### Resolution

The test suggests visiting this webpage for help: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-time-service-tools-and-settings This link should have step-by-step instructions to fix the problem. 

### Verification

After applying the fix, re-run the Environment Validator to confirm the issue is resolved:

```powershell
Invoke-AzStackHciEnvironmentValidator -Validator Software
```
