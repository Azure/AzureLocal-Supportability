# Overview

Environment Validator runs a Validated Recipe validator prior to Update. The test detects issues with inconsistencies between stamp version and services version.

# Symptoms

During pre-update validation, the Validated Recipe tests fail on Test PowerShell Module version.

Inspecting the Pre-Update health check results (the example is PowerShell but these results are available in the console)

Reveals the following failure:

```

```

# Issue Validation

The validation can be run manually to verify and give us more information. Note: you can pass PsSession array to this cmdlet, the example just focusses on running locally.

```
$result = Invoke-AzStackHciValidatedRecipeValidation -PassThru -Include Test-StampVersion
```

The output can be viewed to confirm a failure state:

```

```

# Cause

There is an issue with timing in 2509 release that can cause 2509 stamp version to be incorrectly set on a 2508 services version that is running 2508 components.

# Mitigation Details

We will need to run this command

```
Import-Module ECEClient
$eceClient = Create-ECEClusterServiceClient
# Depending on the OS Version the version is different
$osMajorVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Major.ToString())
$osMinorVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Minor.ToString())
$osBuildVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Build.ToString())
$is23H2 = (($osMajorVersion -eq "10") -and ($osMinorVersion -eq "0") -and ($osBuildVersion -eq "25398"))
if ($is23H2) {
  $stampVersion = "11.2508.1001.51"
} else {
  $stampVersion = "12.2508.1001.52"
}
$eceClient.SetStampVersion($stampVersion).GetAwaiter().GetResult()
$eceClient.InvalidateCloudDefinitionCache().GetAwaiter().GetResult()
```
