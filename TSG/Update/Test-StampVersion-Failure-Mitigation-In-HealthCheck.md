# Overview

Environment Validator runs a Validated Recipe validator prior to Update. The test detects issues with inconsistencies between stamp version and services version.

# Symptoms

During pre-update validation, the Validated Recipe tests fail on Test PowerShell Module version.

Inspecting the Pre-Update health check results (the example is PowerShell but these results are available in the console)

Reveals the following failure:

# Issue Validation

The validation can be run manually to verify and give us more information. 

``` PowerShell
Import-Module ECEClient
$stampInformation = Get-StampInformation
if ("Upgrade" -ne $stampInformation.InstallationMethod) {
    # Not brownfield env, skip checking
    Write-Host "Not HCI environment. Issue does not exist."
} else {
    $servicesVersion = $stampInformation.ServicesVersion
    $stampVersion = $stampInformation.StampVersion
    $stampVersionObj = [Version]::Parse($stampVersion)
    $servicesVersionObj = [Version]::Parse($servicesVersion)
    # Both stampVersion and ServicesVersion are going to be updated during PnU as well.
    $stampVersionMinor = $stampVersionObj.Minor
    $servicesVersionMinor = $servicesVersionObj.Minor
    if ($stampVersionMinor -eq 2509) {
        if ($servicesVersionMinor -eq 2508) {
          Write-Host "Issue exist of mismatched version. Please continue with the mitigation in the TSG."
        } else {
          Write-Host "Not 2508 services version environment. Issue does not exist on the services version $servicesVersionMinor."
        }
    } else {
        # Not impacted by this issue, skip checking
        Write-Host "Not 2509 stamp version environment. Issue does not exist on the build $stampVersionMinor."
    }
}
```

# Cause

There is an issue with timing in 2509 release that can cause 2509 stamp version to be incorrectly set on a 2508 services version that is running 2508 components.

# Mitigation Details

We will need to run this command

``` PowerShell
Import-Module ECEClient
$eceClient = Create-ECEClusterServiceClient
$stampInformation = Get-StampInformation
if ("Upgrade" -ne $stampInformation.InstallationMethod) {
    # Not brownfield env, skip checking
    Write-Host "Not HCI environment. Issue does not exist."
} else {
    $servicesVersion = $stampInformation.ServicesVersion
    $stampVersion = $stampInformation.StampVersion
    $stampVersionObj = [Version]::Parse($stampVersion)
    $servicesVersionObj = [Version]::Parse($servicesVersion)
    # Both stampVersion and ServicesVersion are going to be updated during PnU as well.
    $stampVersionMinor = $stampVersionObj.Minor
    $servicesVersionMinor = $servicesVersionObj.Minor
    if ($stampVersionMinor -eq 2509) {
        # Stamp Version must be 2509
        if ($servicesVersionMinor -eq 2508) {
          Write-Host "Issue exist of mismatched version."
          # Depending on the OS Version the version is different
          $osMajorVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Major.ToString())
          $osMinorVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Minor.ToString())
          $osBuildVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Build.ToString())
          $is23H2 = (($osMajorVersion -eq "10") -and ($osMinorVersion -eq "0") -and ($osBuildVersion -eq "25398"))
          if ($is23H2) {
            $stampVersion = "11.2508.1001.51"
          } else {
            $stampVersion = "12.2508.1001.52"
          }
          # Set Stamp Version
          $eceClient.SetStampVersion($stampVersion).GetAwaiter().GetResult()
          $eceClient.InvalidateCloudDefinitionCache().GetAwaiter().GetResult()
          # Set Initial Deployed Version
          $parametersUpdateDefinition = New-Object Microsoft.AzureStack.Solution.Deploy.EnterpriseCloudEngine.Controllers.Models.CloudParametersUpdateDescription
          $parametersUpdateDefinition.BaseElementXPath = "//Category[@Name='Setup']//Parameter[@Name='InitialDeployedVersion']"
          $parametersUpdateDefinition.Type = "UpdateAttribute"
          $parametersUpdateDefinition.AttributeName = "Value"
          $parametersUpdateDefinition.AttributeValue = $stampVersion
          $null = $eceClient.UpdateCloudParameters($parametersUpdateDefinition).GetAwaiter().GetResult()
          $eceClient.InvalidateCloudDefinitionCache().GetAwaiter().GetResult()
          Write-Host "Fixed issue of mismatched version. Stamp Version is now $stampVersion."
        } else {
          Write-Host "Not 2508 services version environment. Issue does not exist on the services version $servicesVersionMinor."
        }
    } else {
        # Not impacted by this issue, skip checking
        Write-Host "Not 2509 stamp version environment. Issue does not exist on the build $stampVersionMinor."
    }
}
```

Then you will need to do the following: 

``` PowerShell
# Confirm that the StampInformation is now correct
$stampInformation = Get-StampInformation
$stampInformation.StampVersion # This should show either 12.2508.1001.52 or 11.2508.1001.51
```

Check Get-SolutionUpdateEnvironment (This may take a bit of time to reflect, please allow couple minutes if this is not updated yet)

```
$sle = Get-SolutionUpdateEnvironment
$sle.CurrentVersion # This should show same as above
```

Check Get-SolutionUpdate
```
(Get-SolutionUpdate).ResourceId
```

You should see either redmond/Solution12.2509.1001.22 or redmond/Solution11.2509.1001.21 now and should start pnu to 2509 instead of 2510. 
Below command will start the download process and health check of the 2509 pnu package and can follow same guidelines as regular pnu from now on. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/update/about-updates-23h2?view=azloc-2509

```
$resourceId = "[Replace with either redmond/Solution12.2509.1001.22 or redmond/Solution11.2509.1001.21 depending on above]"
Get-SolutionUpdate -id $resourceId | Start-SolutionUpdate -PrepareOnly
```
