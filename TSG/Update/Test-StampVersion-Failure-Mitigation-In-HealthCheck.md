# Overview

Environment Validator runs a Validated Recipe validator prior to Update. The test detects issues with inconsistencies between stamp version and services version.

# Symptoms

During pre-update validation, the Validated Recipe tests fail on Test PowerShell Module version.

Inspecting the Pre-Update health check results (the example is PowerShell but these results are available in the console)

Reveals the following failure:

```

# Issue Validation

The validation can be run manually to verify and give us more information. Note: you can pass PsSession array to this cmdlet, the example just focusses on running locally.

```
$result = Invoke-AzStackHciValidatedRecipeValidation -PassThru -Include Test-StampVersion
```

The output can be viewed to confirm a failure state:

# Cause

There is an issue with timing in 2509 release that can cause 2509 stamp version to be incorrectly set on a 2508 services version that is running 2508 components.

# Mitigation Details

We will need to run this command

```
Import-Module ECEClient
$eceClient = Create-ECEClusterServiceClient
$stampInformation = Get-StampInformation
if ("Upgrade" -ne $stampInformation.InstallationMethod) {
    # Not brownfield env, skip checking
    Write-Host "Not HCI environment. Issue does not exist."
} else {
    $servicesVersion = $stampInformation.ServicesVersion
    $stampVersion = $stampInformation.StampVersion
    $stampVersionObj = [Version]::Parse($stampVersion)
    $servicesVersionObj = [Version]::Parse($servicesVersion)
    # Both stampVersion and ServicesVersion are going to be updated during PnU as well.
    $stampVersionMinor = $stampVersionObj.Minor
    $servicesVersionMinor = $servicesVersionObj.Minor
    if ($stampVersionMinor -eq 2509) {
        # Stamp Version must be 2509
        if ($servicesVersionMinor -eq 2508) {
          Write-Host "Issue exist of mismatched version."
          # Depending on the OS Version the version is different
          $osMajorVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Major.ToString())
          $osMinorVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Minor.ToString())
          $osBuildVersion = $([environment]::OSVersion.Version.Build.ToString())
          $is23H2 = (($osMajorVersion -eq "10") -and ($osMinorVersion -eq "0") -and ($osBuildVersion -eq "25398"))
          if ($is23H2) {
            $stampVersion = "11.2508.1001.51"
          } else {
            $stampVersion = "12.2508.1001.52"
          }
          $eceClient.SetStampVersion($stampVersion).GetAwaiter().GetResult()
          $eceClient.InvalidateCloudDefinitionCache().GetAwaiter().GetResult()
        } else {
          Write-Host "Not 2508 stamp version environment. Issue does not exist on the build $stampVersionMinor."
        }
    } else {
        # Not impacted by this issue, skip checking
        Write-Host "Not 2509 stamp version environment. Issue does not exist on the build $stampVersionMinor."
    }
}
```
