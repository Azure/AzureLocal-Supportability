Solution update to Azure Local 2505 or 2506 fails during the OS update steps with `Previous CAU run status was Canceled` exception in the `EvalCauRetryApplicability` interface.

# Symptoms
Solution update to 2505 or 2506 fails with the following error:

```
CloudEngine.Actions.InterfaceInvocationFailedException: Type 'EvalCauRetryApplicability' of Role 'CAU' raised an exception:

CAU Run failed.Â Previous CAU run status was Canceled. Exceeded max CAU retries (2). Please investigate before retrying.
```

# Issue Validation
To confirm the scenario that you are encountering is the issue documented in this article, confirm you are seeing the following behavior(s)
1. The exception message matches the value shown above including the message `Previous CAU run status was Canceled`.
2. Nobody manually cancelled the CAU run using `Stop-CauRun` (check the timing of the exception to confirm who might have manually cancelled the CAU run)
3. Confirm there is a file present at `C:\ClusterStorage\Infrastructure_1\Shares\SU1_Infrastructure_1\CloudMedia\SBE\Staged\metadata\caufailureinfo.txt`.
4. Attempts to resume/retry the solution update fail on the same step with the same exception.

# Cause
The action plan steps monitoring the CAU run will create a breadcrumb file at the following location:
`C:\ClusterStorage\Infrastructure_1\Shares\SU1_Infrastructure_1\CloudMedia\SBE\Staged\metadata\caufailureinfo.txt`

This file will be created to record when a timeout or error is observed in the middle of the CAU run.  This issue is caused by the breadcrumb file not being removed before each CAU retry.

Note: The breadcrumb is intended to provide a record of exceptions like timeouts at the time the update action plan believes there is a problem with the CAU run with a final evaluation of the CAU run to be done in the `EvalCauRetryApplicability` step. If the determination in that step is that a retry of the CAU run is to be performed, the breadcrumb file is supposed to be removed or renamed to prevent a file from a prior attempt from confusing the next CAU attempt.

# Mitigation Details

To resolve the issue causing the CAU run to automatically cancel:

1. Review the creation date of the breadcrumb file to get  a hint of when your prior CAU run may have had an issue (so that you can review `Get-CauReport -Detailed` for runs at that timeframe):
`Get-Item -Path C:\ClusterStorage\Infrastructure_1\Shares\SU1_Infrastructure_1\CloudMedia\SBE\Staged\metadata\caufailureinfo.txt`.

2. Review the contents of the breadcrumb file.
This will provide insights as to the original CAU issue (e.g. was it a timeout? Which node and stage had the issue?).

3. Attempt to resolve the original issue as reported by the breadcrumb file and/or by `Get-CauReport -Detailed`

4. Assure all nodes are up and that storage is healthy.
```
# Assure all nodes up:
Get-ClusterNode

# Assure the storage pool and virtual disks report 'Healthy' or 'OK' for both HealthStatus and OperationalStatus

Get-StoragePool -IsPrimordial $False | Select-Object HealthStatus, OperationalStatus, ReadOnlyReason

Get-VirtualDisk | Select-Object FriendlyName,HealthStatus, OperationalStatus, DetachedReason
```
For details on checking storage status, see: [Storage Spaces and Storage Spaces Direct health and operational states | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-states)

5. Rename the breadcrumb file before resuming the update:
`Rename-Item -Path C:\ClusterStorage\Infrastructure_1\Shares\SU1_Infrastructure_1\CloudMedia\SBE\Staged\metadata\caufailureinfo.txt -NewName "cauFailureInfo-1stTry.txt"`


### **Additional Notes**
This article focuses on how to resolve the persistent issue where CAU runs are automatically cancelled on each retry attempt following an initial CAU failure.  Prior to applying the mitigation, it is important to investigate the reason for the original failure to avoid that problem repeating.
